<h2> <mark> Greetings </mark> <body text = "black"></h2>
<p>  Becoming more interesting is easy! First, I talk about what I love because my passion is contagious. Then, I share stories that people enjoy and make them feel connected. I'm curious about others and ask questions that keep conversations exciting. Adding humor makes things fun too! Plus, I'm just myselfâ€”authentic and honest. Staying curious about the world and caring about others also helps me be interesting. By doing these simple things, I naturally become someone people love talking to! </p>
